            "I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computing Science based in Glasgow, UK. My main research interests lie in foundational concepts of computing science, such as algorithms, graph theory, and linear algebra. I am also interested in how these concepts can be applied to real-world problems. As a researcher and software developer, I am passionate about designing and implementing algorithms to solve complex problems.",
            "In the past 10 years I have been a math and algorithms tutor at high school and undergraduate level. I have also worked as a data mining analyst in the industry, where I have applied my knowledge of algorithms and data structures to extract insights from large datasets.",
            "Outside the world of computing science, I enjoy playing football with friends and watching football matches, especially those of my favorite team, Olimpia, Paraguay."

Since the b-chromatic colouring problem is NP-hard in general, my work involves looking for polynomial-time solutions in restricted graph classes, such as graphs with a maximum degree of 3 and graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs. I also work on other variants of the b-chromatic colouring problem, such as the fall colouring problem and the total b-chromatic colouring problem."
